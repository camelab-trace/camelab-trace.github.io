<p>Distributed storage system mush keep data available against several hardware/software failures. To achieve this,&nbsp;conventional distributed storage systems employ replication&nbsp;which is a simple but effective method to make distributed storage systems resilient.&nbsp;However, replicating a significant amount of data incurs substantial storage overheads.&nbsp;Therefore, erasure coding becomes an alternative to replication as it can offer the same reliability as or higher reliability than triple replication (denoted by &ldquo;<strong>3-replication</strong>&rdquo;), with much lower storage overheads.&nbsp;The <strong>Reed-Solomon (RS)</strong> code is one of the most popular erasure code&nbsp;due to its optimal storage space utilization.&nbsp;When an RS code is employed, all input data are stored as chunks with a fixed size.&nbsp;In general, RS(k,m) computes m numbers of coding chunk for k numbers of the data chunk, and the system distributes the data and coding chunks across different storage devices or nodes.&nbsp;For example, RS(6,3) splits original data into six data chunks and generates additional three coding chunks.</p>
<h2>The Environment of Trace Collection</h2>
<p>These traces are collected from each system employing <strong>3-replication</strong>, <strong>RS(6,3)</strong>, <strong>RS(10,4)</strong>.&nbsp;Every workload is generated by Flexible I/O tester (FIO).&nbsp;RS(6,3) and RS(10,4) are generally employed by real industry such as Google Colossus and Facebook HDFS, respectively. Our Ceph cluster consists of 24 OSDs; therefore, 24 traces are collected for each workload.</p>
<h2>Trace File Format</h2>
<p>Traces are represented in the default format.&nbsp;From left to right, each column represents &ldquo;the event's device major/minor&rdquo;, &ldquo;CPU ID&rdquo;, &ldquo;sequence number&rdquo;, &ldquo;timestamp (sec)&rdquo;, &ldquo;process ID&rdquo;, &ldquo;I/O status (ex. complete, issued, bounced&hellip;)&rdquo;, &ldquo;RWBS&rdquo;, &ldquo;starting block address&rdquo;, &ldquo;number of blocks&rdquo;, &ldquo;process&rdquo;.</p>
