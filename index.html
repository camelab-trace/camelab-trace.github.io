			<h2>Welcome to Camelab Trace</h2>
		</header>

		<p>Storage traces are widely used for storage simulation and system evaluation. Since high performance SSD, flash array and NVM systems exhibit different I/O timing behaviors, the traditional traces need to be revised or collected on releatively modern systems. To address this, we are collecting different types of traces with many different combinations of devices and systems. Our trace repository distributes traces collected on Kandemir, Wilson, John and Donofrio machines under different types of parallel file systems such as lustre and ceph [<a href="http://camelab.org/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Resource">Check Camelab's high performance computing systems</a>]. Hope that we can secure more traces, which can help storage system and architecture communities to make better and easy-to-reproduce research.</p>

				<h3>Flash-based Block Traces</h3>
				<p>We reconstruct existing block traces which are collected on disk-based storage system by using TraceTracker method on flash-array based system (Kandemir machine).</p>
